# About the game
This is a simple platformer game I developed in vanilla JavaScript, using no libraries, just HTML canvas. <br>
Your goal is to move around the map and collect all the coins, in order to move onto the next level. <br>
Stay alive, don't fall into the water and don't get attacked by the nasty blue slime globs! <br>
Slime globs will appear dormant, but will start moving towards you if you walk into their line of sight. <br>
You can get rid of them by jumping onto them. <br>
(So far there are two levels.) <br>
 

__Note__:
Many important controls, such as gravity, speed, max health, attack power, etc, can be controlled using the consts
which are defined at the beginning of script.js. 

I made this game just to practice and learn JavaScript! Contributions are very welcome! :)
